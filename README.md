# Projectile_air_resistance
This code in python simulates a projectile motion with air resistance in consideration and outputs flight time.
Projectile Motion with Air Resistance
This code implements a simple simulation of projectile motion in a 2D environment, considering the effect of air resistance. The projectile is launched at a given initial velocity and angle from an initial height. The program calculates and outputs the time of flight for the projectile, taking into account the specified air resistance constant and mass of the object.


The simulation assumes the following:

The only forces acting on the projectile are gravity and air resistance.
Air resistance is modeled using linear drag, with the air resistance force proportional to the velocity of the projectile.
The effect of air resistance on the horizontal motion of the projectile is considered by slightly modifying the range calculation.
The mass of the projectile affects the air resistance but does not significantly affect the time of flight in this simplified model.
How to Use
To use the code, simply run the provided script (e.g., main.py) using a Python interpreter. The script will calculate and display the time of flight for the projectile based on the specified parameters. The time of flight is the total time the projectile spends in the air before returning to its initial height.

Make sure to adjust the values of the following parameters in the script according to your specific scenario:

v0: Initial velocity of the projectile (in meters per second).
theta: Launch angle of the projectile (in degrees).
h0: Initial height of the projectile above the ground (in meters).
k: Air resistance constant (in kg/m).
m: Mass of the object (in kilograms).
Dependencies:
The code does not have any external dependencies and only requires a standard Python interpreter to run.

Disclaimer
This simulation is a basic model and may not accurately represent real-world projectile motion in all scenarios. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to consider more complex physics models and factors.
